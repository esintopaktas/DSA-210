# DSA210-Term-Project

I am a student from Sabancı University, Elife Esin Topaktaş, and this is my DSA210 term project. The aim of this project is to analyze the impact of wage growth on access to health insurance in the USA, specifically between the years 1979 and 2019. 

## Topic Overview

This project explores how wage growth (both median and average hourly wages) has influenced health insurance coverage over time. Historically, many workers' ability to afford or access employer-sponsored health insurance has been closely tied to wage levels. This analysis will investigate how periods of stagnant wage growth, particularly for low- and middle-income workers, correlate with a decline in health insurance coverage.

**Key Focus**:  
The primary focus of the analysis is to examine whether periods of stagnant wage growth coincide with decreases in the percentage of people with health insurance, particularly employer-sponsored coverage. This includes analyzing trends in both median and average wages, as well as health insurance coverage data across various demographic groups.

## Motivation

In recent decades, there has been significant discussion around wage growth and its impact on people's access to essential services, including healthcare. As wages have stagnated, especially among low- and middle-income workers, many people have lost access to employer-sponsored health insurance. This project aims to investigate the extent to which wage growth (or lack thereof) affects health insurance coverage, which is vital for the well-being of individuals and families. By exploring this relationship, we hope to understand how economic factors influence public health outcomes and healthcare access in the United States.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between wage growth and health insurance coverage in the United States from 1979 to 2019. Through this analysis, we aim to:

1. Examine how changes in both median and average hourly wages have affected health insurance coverage rates over time.
2. Identify periods of wage stagnation and explore if they coincide with declines in access to employer-sponsored health insurance.
3. Investigate other socio-economic factors that may contribute to these trends.

## Data Sources and Preprocessing

This project uses publicly available datasets from Kaggle to analyze the relationship between wage growth and health insurance coverage. The data sources and preprocessing steps are as follows:

1. **Health Insurance Coverage Data**  
   - The dataset includes health insurance coverage statistics for different types of insurance (e.g., employer-sponsored, public health insurance, and private insurance) across various U.S. states from 1979 to 2019.
   
2. **Wage Data**  
   - The dataset provides median and average hourly wage information in the USA from 1973 to 2022. It includes data on wage growth across different income groups and time periods.

### Preprocessing Steps:
- **Cleaning Data**: Any missing or inconsistent data points are handled using imputation or removal methods.
- **Data Transformation**: The data is formatted into a structured format, and relevant columns are selected for analysis.
- **Normalization**: The wage data and health insurance coverage rates are normalized to ensure consistency in comparisons over time.
  
These datasets will be merged by year and analyzed to explore correlations.
